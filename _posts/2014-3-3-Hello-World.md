title: Photometry and Color-Magnitude Diagram of Hyades Cluster
---

In this project Gaia DR3 photometric and astrometric data from TopCat is used. The Hyades cluster is an ideal target for photometric analysis due to being the closest cluster to solar system (~45 pc) (de Bruijne et al., 2001) and it has a well-defined main sequence which is useful for refinement of the color-magnitude diagram. The dataset properties include G, BP, and RP magnitudes for CMD plotting, parallax measurements to filter out background stars, and proper motion to distinguish true cluster members. Filtering techniques, such as selecting stars based on parallax and proper motion ensure that the result is a clean CMD that would resemble the authentic color-magnitude diagram presented in the reviewed literatures.
A key reference for this research is "A Hipparcos study of the Hyades open cluster: Improved colour-absolute magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams" by J. H. J. de Bruijne, R. Hoogerwerf, and P. T. de Zeeuw. This study, based on Hipparcos data produces a high precision CMD for the Hyades by applying kinematic methods to identify cluster members. This paper is useful for comparing older Hipparcos data with Gaia data thus insights from this study can validate the Gaia-based photometry, selection of Hyades members, and track improvements in the CMD generated in the project.
